          Stock are a piece of paper (now electronic) that say you own a piece of a company. Usually you will buy the stock off another person who has owned it for a while.
This affects you because you are rooting for the well being of the company. You can then vote for their management and have a (very limited) say in how it is run.
If the company makes money and grows two things can occur a) the piece you own grows bigger and is worth more, or b) the company may decide to give you a small portion of the earnings (called dividends). If the company grows you may decide to sell your stock for more money in the future.
I see a lot of answers saying the price depends on the amount of money the company earns. In truth there are many factors. Many people rely on how much the company earns to price the entire company. Other people buy or sell simply because the stock is popular or some news came out. Some people invest just because. The actual price rises or falls because there is a difference between the number of people buying/selling and the price they want to pay.

                But why?
              </div>
              <div>
                As with so many other things, stock makes perfect sense if you look at a little history. Let's go back to the 1600's. England is flexing some serious naval muscle. The Spanish and Portuguese have holdings in the New World. France is looking at Louisiana and seeing dollar signs. It is an age of exploration, and there is a lot of the globe that is still a mystery (at least to Europeans). Europeans are getting a taste for foreign delights and exotic treasures. And especially new foods and spices. In fact, there is a lot of money to be made by buying, building or renting a small armada of merchant ships and sailing to India or the Far East, buying all of the rich spices and fabrics your ships can hold, and then bringing all that delicious goodness back to the nascent foodies and dressmakers in Europe and selling it at a huge mark-up.
  
  If such a venture goes well, the profits can be vast. But mounting such a voyage is expensive. These are big ships. They can be 50 or 100 feet long or more, and very tall. They are capable of sailing for weeks or months, and they require a highly specialized crew, and lots of food and supplies.
  
  Additionally, there are a lot of ways that things can go wrong. Ships sink, winds fail, cargo spoils, crews revolt, buyers get swindled, bugs and rats infest, pirates pillage, water ruins, and storms destroy. A successful voyage can make a fortune. But an unsuccessful voyage can ruin a wealthy family.
  
  So, with the English reaping big rewards from their expeditions to India, the Dutch decide that it is time for them to get in on some Asian trade. Typically back then a few rich people would get together, and invest together on a voyage to India / Asia. They would pool their resources, start a company, buy / rent / build / bankroll some ships, and cross their fingers. Then upon completion of the voyage, they would liquidate the company into either greater wealth or bankruptcy.
  
  But the Dutch decide to do things differently. They charter a single company -- the Dutch East India Company -- and give it a 21 year monopoly to go make money and colonize in Asia. Nobody else will be given a Dutch charter. But, rather than just limit the company to a couple of tycoons, they cut the company up into little pieces (or "shares"), and allow anyone who can afford it to buy stock (a small ownership stake in the company). That way, nobody has to bear the entire expense of the journey alone, nor the catastrophe of a possible failure. And if it is successful, then everyone gets rich together. When the ships come back, the merchandise will be sold, and some of the money will be given to the investors (i.e. they will be given a dividend), and the rest will go into building and supplying more ships to go back and make more money.
  
  Additionally, they reasoned, those shares should be transferable. If somebody decides to sell their "share" of the company, let 'em. That way, if the company seems to be doing well, then the investors can sell their shares at a profit. Or, if the company is doing poorly, then they can sell their shares to others at a loss, but still get something out of it. So they set up the Amsterdam Stock Exchange to handle these and other transactions.
  
  And: BAM. The multi-national, joint-stock company was born.
