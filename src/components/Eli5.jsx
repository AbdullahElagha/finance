          Stock are a piece of paper (now electronic) that say you own a piece
          of a company. Usually you will buy the stock off another person who
          has owned it for a while. This affects you because you are rooting for
          the well being of the company. You can then vote for their management
          and have a (very limited) say in how it is run. If the company makes
          money and grows two things can occur a) the piece you own grows bigger
          and is worth more, or b) the company may decide to give you a small
          portion of the earnings (called dividends). If the company grows you
          may decide to sell your stock for more money in the future. I see a
          lot of answers saying the price depends on the amount of money the
          company earns. In truth there are many factors. Many people rely on
          how much the company earns to price the entire company. Other people
          buy or sell simply because the stock is popular or some news came out.
          Some people invest just because. The actual price rises or falls
          because there is a difference between the number of people
          buying/selling and the price they want to pay.

                As with so many other things, stock makes perfect sense if you
                look at a little history. Let's go back to the 1600's. England
                is flexing some serious naval muscle. The Spanish and Portuguese
                have holdings in the New World. France is looking at Louisiana
                and seeing dollar signs. It is an age of exploration, and there
                is a lot of the globe that is still a mystery (at least to
                Europeans). Europeans are getting a taste for foreign delights
                and exotic treasures. And especially new foods and spices. In
                fact, there is a lot of money to be made by buying, building or
                renting a small armada of merchant ships and sailing to India or
                the Far East, buying all of the rich spices and fabrics your
                ships can hold, and then bringing all that delicious goodness
                back to the nascent foodies and dressmakers in Europe and
                selling it at a huge mark-up. If such a venture goes well, the
                profits can be vast. But mounting such a voyage is expensive.
                These are big ships. They can be 50 or 100 feet long or more,
                and very tall. They are capable of sailing for weeks or months,
                and they require a highly specialized crew, and lots of food and
                supplies. Additionally, there are a lot of ways that things can
                go wrong. Ships sink, winds fail, cargo spoils, crews revolt,
                buyers get swindled, bugs and rats infest, pirates pillage,
                water ruins, and storms destroy. A successful voyage can make a
                fortune. But an unsuccessful voyage can ruin a wealthy family.
                So, with the English reaping big rewards from their expeditions
                to India, the Dutch decide that it is time for them to get in on
                some Asian trade. Typically back then a few rich people would
                get together, and invest together on a voyage to India / Asia.
                They would pool their resources, start a company, buy / rent /
                build / bankroll some ships, and cross their fingers. Then upon
                completion of the voyage, they would liquidate the company into
                either greater wealth or bankruptcy. But the Dutch decide to do
                things differently. They charter a single company -- the Dutch
                East India Company -- and give it a 21 year monopoly to go make
                money and colonize in Asia. Nobody else will be given a Dutch
                charter. But, rather than just limit the company to a couple of
                tycoons, they cut the company up into little pieces (or
                "shares"), and allow anyone who can afford it to buy stock (a
                small ownership stake in the company). That way, nobody has to
                bear the entire expense of the journey alone, nor the
                catastrophe of a possible failure. And if it is successful, then
                everyone gets rich together. When the ships come back, the
                merchandise will be sold, and some of the money will be given to
                the investors (i.e. they will be given a dividend), and the rest
                will go into building and supplying more ships to go back and
                make more money. Additionally, they reasoned, those shares
                should be transferable. If somebody decides to sell their
                "share" of the company, let 'em. That way, if the company seems
                to be doing well, then the investors can sell their shares at a
                profit. Or, if the company is doing poorly, then they can sell
                their shares to others at a loss, but still get something out of
                it. So they set up the Amsterdam Stock Exchange to handle these
                and other transactions. And: BAM. The multi-national,
                joint-stock company was born.
